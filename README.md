## Overview

KrakeOS is a hobby operating system written in Rust. It includes a custom bootloader, basic multitasking, memory management, hardware drivers, a filesystem, and a graphical window manager. This is a learning project that explores OS development from the ground up.

## Features

### Core Kernel & Architecture
- x86_64 (Long Mode)
- Custom multi-stage bootloader (Swiftboot)
- Preemptive multitasking with round-robin scheduling
- User mode (Ring 3) support
- Around 25 system calls using `syscall`/`sysret`
- Context switching with FPU/SSE state save/restore

### Memory Management
- 4-level paging (PML4)
- Virtual memory manager
- Physical frame allocator
- Separate heap allocators for kernel and userspace
- Page-level memory protection and NX bit support

### Drivers

**Graphics:**
- VirtIO GPU with hardware-accelerated 2D and hardware cursor
- VBE framebuffer fallback

**Storage:**
- VirtIO Block device
- ATA/IDE (PIO mode)
- DMA support (PIIX4 Bus Mastering)

**Input:**
- PS/2 Keyboard with modifier keys
- PS/2 Mouse with scroll wheel support

**Other:**
- PCI enumeration and configuration
- PIT for scheduling
- RTC for timekeeping

### Filesystem
- Ext2 read/write support
- Virtual filesystem (VFS) layer
- Anonymous pipes for IPC
- ELF loader for 64-bit PIE executables

### Window Manager
- In-kernel compositing window manager
- Z-ordering, alpha blending, and transparency
- SSE-optimized blitting
- Window dragging, resizing, and focus management
- Dirty rectangle tracking and double buffering

### Userland
- Custom Rust standard library and C library (krake_libc)
- Interactive shell with pipes
- Terminal emulator with ANSI escape codes
- InkUI widget library (buttons, windows, labels, layouts)
- Apps: taskbar, cat, texture mapper
- DOOM (via doomgeneric)

## Building & Running
```bash
# You'll need: Rust nightly, QEMU, and build tools

# Build
make build

# Run
make run
```

## Why?

This is a learning project. The goal is to understand how operating systems work by building one from scratch. It's not meant to be production-ready or particularly practical—just a fun way to learn about kernels, drivers, and low-level programming.
